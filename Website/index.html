           <div class="about-me__body">
               <p>My name is Jia Quan, or you can call me JQ in short. I'm currently a year 3 Electronics student in Temasek Polytechnic. As an curious minded person, 
                I have always been interested to learn more about how things work. However, after studying Electronics for a couple of years and taking a few modules which touches on the software (eg. Python, Data Analytics), 
                I noticed that my interest in software was growing far more and I started being so facinated and curious by how digitalisation is changing the world rapidly, which makes me want to be a part of the process!.
                </p>
               <p>As a technology enthusiast, I am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow in the field. I am particularly drawn to hackathons as a way to push my limits and collaborate with others to create innovative solutions.
                In addition to my passion for tech, I am also dedicated to giving back and making a positive impact in society. I believe that every person has the power to make a difference, and I enjoy volunteering as a way to contribute to my community and make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's through donating my time or using my skills for the greater good, I am always looking for ways to make a difference and create meaningful change. 
                I am excited to connect with others who share this vision.
                My current goal is to work towards a degree in Information Systems and create an impact in the society with the technical and management skills Iâ€™ve attained and my ultimate goal would be to pursue a career in the IT sector!
                Aside from my career goals, my active hobbies are hitting the gym, hiking, cycling or anything to do with outdoors! I also play the piano once in awhile and embark on mini Python 
                projects on Data Analytics to gain more knowledge.</p>
